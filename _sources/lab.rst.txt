The operating system you will build, called *JOS*, will have Unix-like
functions, but is implemented in an `Exokernel <r/exokernel:sosp95.pdf>`__ style (i.e., the
functions are implemented mostly as user-level library instead of
built-in to the kernel).

.. note::

 The labs used here are largely based on the materials originally
 developed for
 `MIT 6.828: Operating System Engineering <https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/index.html>`__.
